Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a field of engineering that applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power aspects of modern life such as commerce,healthcare,entertainment and communication.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Introduction of high-level programming languages-Early computers were programmed in machine code or assembly language which was complex and error-prone,the introduction of high level language like FORTRAN and COBOL made programming more accessible and laid the groundwork for modern software development.
-The birth of structured programming-structured programming introduced the use of clear control structures which made programseasier to understand,maintain and debug. -Rise of agile methodology-Agile methods shifted focus from rigid,linear development processes to flexible approaches that prioritize customer feedback and adaptability.This revolutionized how software is developedmaking it more responsive to changing requirements and user needs
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-Define the project goals,scope and feasibility.Decide what your software should achieve. 2.Requirement analysis:Gather and document what the software must do. 3.Design:Create a blueprint for the software and also plan how it will work with user interface and data flow. 4.Development:Write the code according to the design. 5.Testing:Check the software for bugs or issues to ensure it works as expected. 6.Deployment:Release the software to users. 7.Maintenance:Update and fix the software overtime.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall has a linear process meaning it follows a step-by-step sequence while agile uses iterative process which develops software in small,repeated cycle.
-Waterfall is rigid meaning once a phase is completed,it is hard to go back and make changes while agile is flexible as it easily accomodates changes and continuous feedback.             -Example scenario of waterfall is a construction of a building where requirements are clear and changes are costly after the project starts while example scenario of  agile is developing a mobile app where user needs might evolve and ongoin feedback is necessary.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer writes code to build the software,his responsibilities include developing features,fixing bugs nd implementing designs.
-A quality assurance engineer ensures the software works correctly,his responsibilities are testing the software,finding bugs and ensures it meets quality standards before release.
-Project manager oversees the entire project,his responsibilities are planning, organizing and tracking projects.He stays on budget and ensures the team meets the deadline.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs provide tools for writing,editing and debugging code in one place which makes coding faster and more efficient for example visual studio code which offers code editing, syntax highlighting,debugging tools and extension.
-VCS tracks changes to code over time,allowing people to work on the same project and manage different version of the software.For example GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Managing requirements changes. Strategy: use agile methodology to adapt to changes quickly and involve stakeholders regularly.
-Debugging complex issues. Strategy: use debuggung tools and break problems into smaller parts to isolate issues.
-Meeting deadlines. Strategy: plan tasks and manage time well.
-Collaboration challenges. Strategy:use collaboration tools.
-Ensuring code quality. Starategy: follow coding standards.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing- it tests individual components or functions of the code to ensure they work correctly in isolation. IMPORTANCE:Helps catch and fix bugs early in development.
-Integration testing-Tests the interaction between integrated components to ensure they work together. IMPORTANCE: Identifies issues that occur when different parts of the software interact.
-System testing-Tests the complete,integrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. IMPORTANCE:Ensures that the entire system funtions as expected in a real-world scenario.
-Acceptance testing-Validates that the software meets the end-user's requirement and is ready for deployment. IMPORTANCE:Confirms that the sofware is ready for release and meets user expectation.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best response from your robot                          

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Tell me about the project"
Improved prompt"Can you provide a summary of the project's objectives"
Why it is more effective
-Clarity-specifies what information is needed.
-Conciseness-focuses on essential details avoiding ambiguity.
